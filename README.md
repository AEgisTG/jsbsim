# AEgis Technology Groups Modified JSBSim

This repo contains a slightly modified version of JSBSim used internally at AEgis.  The AEgis changes to the JSBSim source are made available here, and our current working version is maintained at `master` branch.

The branch `upstream` is used to pull updates from the official SourceForge repository located at `git://git.code.sf.net/p/jsbsim/code`.

The original README file is in the root of the repository for reference.
